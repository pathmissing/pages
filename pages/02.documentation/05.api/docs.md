appserver.io up from version 1.1.1 comes with a RESTFul JSON API that can be browsed with the bundled Swagger UI via the URL `http://127.0.0.1:9024/swagger-ui/`. 

The API itself has been implemented as a Web Application using the Servlet Engine and follows the [json:api](http://jsonapi.org/) specification.

## Availability

The API is deployed in a separate container and, for security reasons, by default not available from the internet, but from the local system only. The default port is `9024`. To make it available, the IP for the responsible server has to be changed from `127.0.0.1` to one, that is reachable from the internet or `0.0.0.0` to listen to all IP addresses bound to the server's network interfaces.
